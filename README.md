## What is Mlem?
Mlem is a client for [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org), a Reddit-esque, open-source link aggregator. With Mlem, you can effortlessly participate in the conversation across all Lemmy servers. 

You can discuss and ask questions about Mlem at the [community on lemmy.ml](https://lemmy.ml/c/mlemapp).

## Why Use Mlem?

Unlike many other clients, Mlem is designed to be easy to use first. Its UI is beautiful and intuitive, and it just gets out of your way so you can enjoy participating in the communities that matter to you the most.

And that's not all; Mlem is also extensively optimized and performant, which means it will never be a performance and battery hog. You can scroll all day and night long!
